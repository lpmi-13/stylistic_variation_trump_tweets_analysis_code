0.517	13994.         @Katdhairstudio Thanks, but I don't feel like it--work too hard!
0.516	17178.         @alancravey  That is something to think about, isn't it!
0.516	17089.         @caarlatwiter  She's fantastic.
0.513	16686.         @sbair115 @gretawire  They call me names but that's ok?
0.51	18241.         @michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U.S. --- he wasn't.
0.51	18175.         @BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!
0.506	17652.         Networks are all wanting me to do shows—like it or not a “ratings machine”! –but time, I run a really big company!
0.505	10362.         The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know. How can you possibly discover anything if you already know everything?
0.505	14818.         @MdAhGOD Not much, it's too easy!
0.504	17851.         It’s amazing how people can talk about me but I’m not allowed to talk about them.
0.503	13235.         @tuserious854 I love what I do. You have to have passion for your work in order to be successful. That's number one.
0.503	12464.         @OriginalArts1  Thank you, it is great. You have real talent!
0.502	13117.         @DianeJackson9 If you love what you're doing, the energy and passion will be there. It's the best way to succeed.
0.501	20484.         @HangersMensLine  My agenda is such that I can't meet with you, but it's always nice to be asked and I wish you the best.
0.5	17885.         She’s baaack! @Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. But it won’t help-- she’s got no talent &amp; no persona. Too many tv cancellations!
0.5	17848.         @jackmarkou @CelebApprentice @piersmorgan  He is on and he's great!
0.5	16436.         @Brendamckinley  They were amazing, thanks!
0.499	446.                Melania, our great and very hard working First Lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that “if you run, you will win.” She would tell everyone that, “no doubt, he will win.” I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
0.499	141.                Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don’t want to do it but are powerless!
0.499	1740.            Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
0.498	14265.         @Lord_Sugar can't hold a.candle to Donald.Trump - he is a laughing stock in Great Britain (but his show pays me lots of money, so I'm happy)
0.498	13249.         @TrumpDoral @RealJoeBrady It will really be amazing when complete.
0.498	13502.         @IAMAASHKA    Thanks, it will be great.
0.498	17576.         @Alkiwaves Thanks, it will be great.
0.495	15753.         @Trish3D @TraceAdkins @CelebApprentice @RedCross  He's great!
0.495	13763.         @rtwing1020  Thanks--it will be great.
0.495	17682.         @BrainyRedhead @CelebApprentice @TraceAdkins Thanks--it will be great.
0.494	14866.         Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it. Fear is the opposite of faith.
0.493	2165.            Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not....
0.492	8400.            .@JohnLegere  T-Mobile service is terrible! Why can't you do something to improve it for your customers. I don't want it in my buildings.
0.492	14063.         @DannyZuker Bigger means bigger dummy, you really are stupid, aren't you!
0.491	17677.         "It’s more important to be smart than tough. I know businessmen who are brutally tough, but they’re not smart.” – Think Like A Billionaire
0.491	12447.         @Miranda_Diplo              "I like Hilary Clinton. She is very admirable. But @realDonaldTrump is our nation's answer." Thanks.
0.489	10771.         .@sethmeyers  Seth can't help it - he is really trying hard but just doesn't have what it takes. Very awkward and insecure!
0.488	17694.         @PaulBocian Thanks, it was wonderful.
0.487	5754.            The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
0.487	17092.         @conniegrn777 @AlabamaFTBL  You should--they are great!
0.487	16443.         @ErolYalim  Could be true--thanks.
0.487	17625.         @sbowlin1  Thanks--you will love it.
0.485	14724.         @sonoman24 @stephenbaldwin @ApprenticeNBC  I was not thrilled but left them in because the show is real.
0.484	10823.         “I'm not afraid of failing. I don't like to fail. I hate to fail. But I'm not afraid of it.” - @VinceMcMahon
0.483	14663.         Being tough doesn’t mean being nasty, difficult, or unreasonable. It means being tenacious and refusing to give in or give up.
0.482	12748.         Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him "don't do it". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.
0.482	14539.         @DPMurphy93 That's true--they all ask!
0.481	11517.         Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster. Never look back, just learn from your experience!
0.481	15054.         @CreelKen  Hope I do well!
